# Project - Hangman

This project entails individually implementing a popular rudimentary game in JavaScript - "Hangman". There will be code and a structure provided as support, which you can use as a guide when solving the task.

Hangman is a game where a word is randomly selected. The player then guesses which letters the word contains. For each incorrect guess, a part of the "hangman" image is drawn. If the player guesses incorrectly enough times and the hangman has been fully drawn, the player loses. However, if the player successfully guesses all the letters, they win.

## Introduction
This project was an introduction to working with JavaScript for me. Implementing the Hangman game was not only enjoyable but also a really interesting way to delve into JavaScript programming. I was highly motivated throughout the project and found it to be a pleasure to work on.

## Grading
I'm proud to share that I received another "Very Good" grade for this project. "Nice, simple, and user-friendly solution that still demonstrates increased understanding. Well done."

## Conclusion
Working on this project was not only educational but also a rewarding experience. It helped me strengthen my JavaScript skills. I look forward to applying what I've learned to future projects.
